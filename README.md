# Terraform Project Restructuring Experience
This project served as a learning journey where I practiced restructuring Terraform configurations as infrastructure setups evolve. Initially, I deployed two instances of a web application hosted in separate S3 buckets, representing production and development environmentsâ€”all managed within a single configuration file, creating a monolithic setup.

Throughout this tutorial, I navigated the process of evolving this monolithic setup into distinct configurations for each environment. I gained hands-on experience in restructuring Terraform projects, transforming the initial monolith into independently managed configurations and states for both production and development environments.

This tutorial was instrumental in understanding practical methods of managing evolving infrastructure setups using Terraform. It provided insights into effectively restructuring and managing Terraform configurations as projects expand and become more complex.
